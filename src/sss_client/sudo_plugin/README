  to connect to multiple different account sources. SSSD SUDO project is a 
  plugin based system that gives the power of implemnting sudo rules into an 
  ldap server and authenticates users based on these sudo rules with the help
  of cached credentials of SSSD. It is a helpful tool to create new access 
  policies and to implment it to wide range of users with common LDAP repository
